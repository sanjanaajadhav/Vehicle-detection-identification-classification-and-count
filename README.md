Project Overview

This project aims to detect, classify, and count vehicles in a given video or image dataset using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The models used in this project can differentiate between four vehicle classes:

Car
Truck
Bus
Motorcycle
Goals
Detect vehicles accurately.
Classify vehicles into specific categories.
Count vehicles to provide quantitative insights.
Files in This Repository

Vehicle_detection_classification.ipynb:
Contains code for vehicle detection and classification. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation sections.
19_Vehicle_Detection_Classification_Counting.ipynb:
Expands on the detection and classification notebook by adding vehicle counting functionality. It includes sample code for detecting and counting vehicles from videos.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for development.
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the deep learning models.
YOLO (You Only Look Once): For real-time object detection.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
How to Run the Notebooks

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-detection-classification.git
cd vehicle-detection-classification

Set up the virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

jupyter notebook

Sample Outputs

Detection and Classification:
Counting:
The system counts and displays the number of vehicles detected in each frame.
Dataset

You will need a dataset containing labeled images or videos of vehicles. Some commonly used datasets are:

COCO Dataset (Common Objects in Context): COCO
Open Images Dataset: Open Images
Future Enhancements

Support for More Vehicle Types.
Integration with Real-Time Traffic Analysis Systems.
Optimization for Faster Inference on Edge Devices.
